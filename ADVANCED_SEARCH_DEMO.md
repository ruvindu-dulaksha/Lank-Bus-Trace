## 🔍 How It Works

### User Query: "Colombo to Kandy"
1. **Route Matching**: Finds all routes between cities using fuzzy search
2. **Trip Filtering**: Gets available trips for specified date
3. **Pricing Calculation**: 
   - Base fare + distance fare
   - Bus type multipliers (Standard: 1.0x, Semi-luxury: 1.2x, Luxury: 1.5x)
   - Time-based surcharges (weekend, holiday, peak hours)
   - Dynamic pricing based on demand
4. **Availability Check**: Real-time seat availability
5. **Sorting**: By price, departure time, or duration

### Pricing Formula
```
Final Price = (Base Fare + Distance Fare) × Bus Type Multiplier + Surcharges
```

**Example for Semi-luxury bus:**
- Base Fare: LKR 150
- Distance Fare: 115.5 km × LKR 1.2 = LKR 138
- Subtotal: LKR 288
- Semi-luxury Multiplier: 288 × 1.2 = LKR 346
- Holiday Surcharge: +LKR 20
- **Total: LKR 366 per person**
