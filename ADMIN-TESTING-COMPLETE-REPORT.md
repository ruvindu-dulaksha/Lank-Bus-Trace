## 📝 Notes on Non-Functional Endpoints

During comprehensive testing, some endpoints returned 404 or 403 errors. Analysis shows:

### 404 Endpoints (Not Implemented)
These are documented in Swagger but not yet implemented in the codebase:
- `/api/info`, `/api/auth/profile`, `/api/auth/generate-api-key`
- Various tracking endpoints (`/buses/{id}/tracking`, `/trips/{id}/tracking`)
- Some specialized endpoints (`/buses/fleet/status`, `/routes/{id}/buses`)

### 403 Endpoints (Role-Restricted)
These correctly return 403 as they require specific roles (driver, conductor, operator):
- `/api/driver/*` endpoints - Require driver role
- `/api/conductor/*` endpoints - Require conductor role  
- `/api/operator/*` endpoints - Require operator role

**This is correct security behavior** - admin users should not have access to role-specific endpoints.
